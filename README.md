# Smart Car Parking System Code
This is a design for a Smart Car Parking System at Murang'a Town. 
Main Objective
The main objective of this project was to design and implement a system that would provide parking occupancy estimation and parking analytics for Murang’a town. With the developed digital system providing a means for remote parking space checking to enhance parking space utilization, the project objectives were achieved, and challenges associated with parking in Murang’a town were validated. An intelligent parking system will allow drivers to check for available parking spaces beforehand, get real-time parking information, and enable the Murang’a town authority to use parking analytics for town planning.
