# A Smart Car Parking System
This is a proposed smart car parking system using Arduino. 
## Objective
The main objective of this project was to design and implement a system that would provide parking occupancy estimation and parking analytics for Murang’a town residents. With the developed digital system providing a means for remote parking space checking to enhance parking space utilization, the project objectives were achieved, and challenges associated with parking in Murang’a town were validated. An intelligent parking system will allow drivers to check for available parking spaces beforehand, get real-time parking information, and enable the Murang’a town authority to use parking analytics for town planning.
